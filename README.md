# Project

This repository provides the code for training of the models for Human Activity Recognition Component for Robocomp.  
Code for the components themselves has been done in the Robocomp's forks, these are the pull requests:  
[Interfaces](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/pull/224)  
[Components](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp-robolab/pull/28)

# Content

This repository consists of the:  
* code for classical machine learning with SVM and hand-crafted features
* code for transfer learning with convolutional neural network
* inference code used in the components
* summary of relevant research materials

# Use

Both of the training related directories have their own detailed READMEs. Please check those out.
